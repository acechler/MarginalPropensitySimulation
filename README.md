# MarginalPropensitySimulation
Simulates the Macroeconomics concept of marginal propensity to save/consume.

Equation: MPC = dC/dY
  MPC = Marginal Propensity to Consume
  C   = Consumption Function
  Y   = Change in disposable income that produced the function.

Example
       
       MPC = 0.6
       MPS = 0.4
       MPC + MPS = 1

       Consumer has $20
       They will consume $20 * MPC(0.6) = $12
       They will save $20 * MPS(0.4) = $8
       12 + 8 = 20
